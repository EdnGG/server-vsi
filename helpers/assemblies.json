        "steps" : "Place the valve in the press. Make sure it is tight and does not fall off. Clean the seal well with the white lubricant until the seal is clean. Open the valve and make sure the stem is marked correctly with the position of the valve disc. Put grease on the stem and make sure the 27M22 insert engages. Place the motor in the open position. Verify that the 27M22 insert fits correctly into the motor. In case it doesn't fit well? Sand the insert so that it fits correctly. Then start calibrating the valve using the control pack with signals of 2-10 and 4-20. Calibrate the valve as required. Make sure you add the correct instructions for the actuator and control pack"
